# Ways to Print Data

These could all be made into webservices which we can extend our API endpoints with.

## Maps
* [Kartograph.py](http://kartograph.org/docs/kartograph.py) - supports .shp and postgis to really nice images.  Could make this a really nice webservice for printing chloropleth maps for our projects.

## Charts

* [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) - Really beautiful printable charts based on matplotlib. 
 * [Category data](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/categorical_linear_models.html) - point and bar charts - 
 * [Heat Maps](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/dataset_exploration.html)
 * [Facet Grids](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/axis_grids.html)
 * [Histograms](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/plotting_distributions.html#basic-visualization-with-histograms)
