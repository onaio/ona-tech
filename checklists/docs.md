How to write good docs and doc strings
---

Documentation is important.

[Python Docstring Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
  * [One-line docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#one-line-docstrings) are for obvious cases.
  * [Multi-line docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#multi-line-docstrings) summarize behavior and document arguments, return value(s), side effects, exceptions raised, and restrictions on when it can be called (all if applicable).
